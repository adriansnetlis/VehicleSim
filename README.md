# VehicleSim
[EN] A car simulation using spring-mass physics. It's an assiting project for Rigs of Rods project 'NextSim' aswell as my school scientific research.

Language:
C++, OpenGL

Target platforms:
Windows, Linux, Mac

Libraries used:
[empty]

Workflow plan:
 1. Graphics environment    
  1.1. Must include custom normal generation mode    
  1.2. Performance-optimized for primary tests, performance/quality balanced for final release    
 2. Universal physics model(for objects and surfaces)    
 3. Editor with GUI    
  3.1. Features included:    
    3.1.1. Create, remove, move, duplicate mass nodes and mass node groups    
    3.1.2. Create, remove, configure springs between mass nodes    
    3.1.3. Auto-calculate mode for springs(using generalized material and surface shaping as input).    
 4. Advanced drivetrain components    
  4.1. Engine, transmission, differentials, axis, suspension systems, electronics    
 5. Tire and wheel model    
 6. Physics playground    
 7. Tweaks, bugfixes, optimization    
 8. Final release
