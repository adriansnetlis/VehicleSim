Plans:
 * Use of SDL 2 graphics library for C++. I will have to find some tutorials to do this.
 * Wireframe shader for debug and technical analysis, solid(clay-shaded) and solid(shadeless-texture) shaders for modelling & physically based shader(based on GGX & schlick's fresnel approximation) for game-level preview.

Editor structure:
 * [to be updated]
